                <p>When I found out I was going to be learning how to work with CSS, I was about to break down into tears - happy tears, of course! I could not believe one of my lifelong dreams was about to come true: I would be learning the most beautiful style sheet language in the whole world. It was not always easy, though - there were some bumps on the road. But with my steely determination and the help from my extremely talented, knowledgeable and humble teacher, I was able to overcome every difficulty that came upon me. Maybe learning CSS is the best thing that has ever happened to me; it has spurred my creativity in ways I no longer thought possible. I will always love and cherish CSS and here are some of my delicately crafted webpages to attest to it.</p>

                    <h1>(Not so) Plain CSS</h1>
                </div>

                <p>I am not afraid to admit my first jobs are not exactly stellar. At least I can see a steady progress, and after all, learning a new language was never going to be easy.</p>

                <p>I could see CSS was going to be as challenging as fascinating, and that made me all the more excited. We can all see these were no masterpieces, but <span>Vanilla CSS</span> is full of charm anyway, don't you think?</p>

                </div>

                <p>We all love floating. It's so much fun and sometimes unpredictable, which makes it even more exciting. When I was learning how to use <span>floats</span>, I would often find myself daydreaming and thinking about <span>the perfect CSS file</span>.</p>
                <p>Would I ever be able to create the ultimate CSS file? Would I ever get millions of people to praise my code's pristine beauty? Only time will tell...</p>

                    <h1>Position me, baby!</h1>
                </div>

                <p>Location, location, location. That’s all that mattered to me at some point. I was getting frustrated! For some reason some CSS elements refused to position themselves where I wanted them to be. Luckily, my new best friend <span>position</span> came to the rescue.</p>
                
                <img src="./images/position.jpg" alt="position"/>

                <p>All my prayers had been answered, at last. I positioned elements everywhere at the drop of a hat, and all of them simply complied. I was feeling more powerful than ever before, but the road to enlightenment was still full of twists and turns.</p>

                </div>

                <p>Oh, <span>FlexBox.</span> You will always be special to me. You showed me there are other ways to design complex webpage layouts, and I will never forget about that. It is as if you unlocked a door for me, a door which lead the way to a magic fantasy land where my creativity could finally run unbridled and free.</p>
                <p>I was no longer tied to restrictions - if I could imagine it, I could code it. And that was all thanks to you, <span>FlexBox</span>. I am sure we will be friends forever.</p>

                    <h1>A serious affair: CSS Grid</h1>

                <p>Just when I thought I knew how to use CSS, along came <span>CSS Grid</span>. I am not gonna lie, I was scared at first. <span>Grid</span> is the gateway to a complex, bidimensional world. But at the same time it is so tempting, intriguing and sexy.</p>
                
                <img src="./images/grid.jpg" alt="grid"/>

                <p>With <span>FlexBox</span> and <span>Grid</span> I felt truly unstoppable, and once I got the hang of it, I finally unlocked all my full potencial as a frontend developer. The world is my oyster now, and I'm certainly here for it. <span>CSS Grid</span> made it happen, and it helped me become the best coder I can possibly be.</p>

                <p>The icing on the cake was <span>Responsive Web Design</span>. I felt like the most powerful wizard, shaping the most intricate layouts and creating order from chaos. Just with a little tweaking, I manifested my most fascinating and out-there ideas onto the code.</p>
                <p>CSS had no secrets for me anymore. Finally, I became a superlative "CSS whisperer". <span>I am CSS and CSS is me</span>. You can call me a rockstar frontend developer.</p>
